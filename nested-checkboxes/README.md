## Introduction 

Build a component that displays a hierarchical structure of checkboxes. The component should handle parent-child relationships between checkboxes and manage their states efficiently.

### Requirements
* A checkbox's value is determined by the value of its direct children:
  * When all children of a parent are checked, the parent should be checked.
  * When some (but not all or none) children of a parent are checked, the parent should be in an indeterminate state, with a dash displayed within the box.
  * When none of the children of a parent are checked, the parent is unchecked.
* If a parent checkbox is checked or unchecked, all the descendant checkboxes (not just direct children) will be updated with that new value.
* The focus of the exercise is on the functionality and not the styling. You may style the checkboxes in any way you prefer as long as the states are clear.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
